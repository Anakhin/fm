	+ Supports attribute comparison
	+ Can ignore common 'false time differences'
	+ Supports limited contents comparison (only first N Kb)

	! Supports caching comparison results - so that if you compared C:\Dir1 and
	  D:\Dir2\SubDir1, you will get results for C:\Dir1\SD2 and
	  D:\Dir2\SubDir1\SD2 instantly, without rescanning deeper.
	  Cache is automatically flushed when changes are detected in one of compared
	  directories.
